# IP Scanner Tool (Bash Script for Kali Linux)

🔍🖥 This tool is an IP scanner built with **Bash scripting** specifically for **Kali Linux**. It scans for open ports within a Local Area Network (LAN) and stands out for its **stealthy approach** 🕵🏻. The tool sends its scan outputs to `/dev/null` (Linux's "black hole"), making it ideal for discreet network exploration and remote use on another Kali machine.

This script is a valuable addition to any **network security toolkit**. Check it out and enhance your network reconnaissance capabilities!
